## Why?
Following the Domain-driven design philosophy is a slippery slope with a steep learning curve. While it is relatively easy to understand the basics, some aspects take several months (or years) to master.
Implementing it using Event Sourcing and CQRS complicates the problem further, as some options are better than others. 

There are a plethora of more or less simplistic articles on the internet, but getting started with Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS is hard - especially if one does not know where to look. 

As a company looking to start the next DDD + ES + CQRS project, it might be difficult to choose a suitable technology stack. Extensive research is required in order to assess possible options.
There is a risk tapping into common pitfalls that can be avoided.

The DDD Alliance solves this problem by
* helping you getting started
* providing a knowledge base about best practices and technologies
