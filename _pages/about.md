# Core values
- **Transparency:** Transparency is a pivotal value for us at the DDD Alliance. Our vendor-neutral and impartial stance underscores the importance of clarity in our decision-making processes. It is essential that individuals from outside the DDD Alliance can readily comprehend the entire journey, from the initial decision to the final solution.

- **Continuous Learning and Decision-Making:** At the DDD Alliance, we place a strong emphasis on continuous learning. We recognize that achieving a _perfect_ decision is often elusive. Therefore, we adopt a _good enough for now, safe enough to try_ approach to decision-making. This approach allows us to make informed choices, learn from the results, and adapt based on the knowledge we gain along the journey.

- **Community Focus:** Community holds significant importance within the DDD Alliance. Membership in our alliance signifies a commitment to placing individual or specific interests in the background, with a primary focus on prioritizing the collective good of the entire community.

- **Inclusivity and Non-Discrimination:** We uphold a commitment to fostering an environment where all individuals are welcomed and respected, regardless of their background, identity, or beliefs. Discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and we actively work to ensure that our community is inclusive and free from bias.
